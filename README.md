# tidy-exercises

This is a collection of [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) exercises I've
carried out. I started doing this to keep my data science skills sharp, and to
learn new stuff by studying data. I try to keep up with the
[TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) exercises, though
occasionally I wrangle data from other sources.

# History

Here's a history of the exercises, along with a brief description of lessons learned.

- 2019-11-08: [US PhD's Awarded](https://github.com/zdelrosario/tidy-exercises/blob/master/2019/2019-02-19-usphds/eda.md)
  + Some disciplines have an *astounding* number of sub-disciplines, especially the Life Sciences.
  + As an engineer, I was very surprised to see that the vast majority of PhD's awarded per-year in the US go to Social and Life scientists, with Engineering, CS, and Math/Stats far fewer in number.
- 2019-11-24: [Dept. of Education Outcomes Data](https://github.com/zdelrosario/tidy-exercises/blob/master/2019/2019-11-22-ed-data/outcomes.md)
  + A large *count* of Title IV funding tends to go to Business Admin majors, but more *dollars* of Title IV funding go (unsurprisingly) to medical professionals.
  + Most engineering degrees seem to have similar earnings; the outliers are Naval/Marine architecture degree holders (who earn more), and Environment-related degree holders (who earn less).
  + Computer Technologies/Technician degrees seem to be a racket; these graduates end up with higher debt, but make a bit less than other degree holders.
- 2019-12-03: [Philadelphia Parking Violations](https://github.com/zdelrosario/tidy-exercises/blob/master/2019/2019-12-03-phily-tickets/proc.md)
  + In Philadelpha, incidents of parking violations follow a clear weekly trend, with the greatest violations on Thursdays, and far fewer on the weekends.
  + National holidays lead to far fewer violations as people stay home, but it seems that strong snowstorms have the same effect in this Northeastern city. Having grown up in PA I know what snowstorms are like, but I didn't realize they had a similar effect on traffic violations as national holidays.
- 2019-12-10: [UNDOC Homicide Data](https://github.com/zdelrosario/tidy-exercises/blob/master/2019/2019-12-10-news-plots/proc.md)
  + US general homicide rates are much higher than other developed nations; about 3x that of Canada
  + US gun homicide rates are similarly high; the US *firearm homicide* rate is higher than the *general homicide* rate of many nations of similar wealth
  + Firearm homicide data are fairly sparse
- 2019-12-25: [Christmas songs on the Top-100](https://github.com/zdelrosario/tidy-exercises/blob/master/2019/2019-12-24-hot100/proc.md)
  + Christmas songs on the Top-100 were common from around 1958 through the early 60's. They have become rarer since.
  + A few Christmas songs have enjoyed "revivals":
    - Some artists re-chart, such as Nat King Cole's "The Christmas Song" charted decades apart (first in 1960, recently in 2017)
	- Others were re-interpreted, such as "Please Come Home for Christmas" first by Charlie Brown (1961), then by The Eagles (1979)
  + Christmas songs tend to use words with positive sentiment, and tend to be lyrically simple: If a Christmas song has 100 words in its lyrics, it will tend to repeat the same 18 words
- 2019-12-31: [IMDB TV Shows](https://github.com/zdelrosario/tidy-exercises/blob/master/2019/2019-12-31-imdb/proc.md)
  + TV shows need time to "get good" as measured by their average rating score, which tends to peak around season 5.
  + TV shows also seem to be renewed at different rates across genres. Shows of the Action, Adventure, Comedy, Crime, Mystery, Romance, and Family genre seem to be more reliably renewed than others.
