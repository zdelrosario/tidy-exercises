# tidy-exercises

This is a collection of [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) exercises I've
carried out. I started doing this to keep my data science skills sharp, and to
learn new stuff by studying data. I try to keep up with the
[TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) exercises, though
occasionally I wrangle data from other sources.

# History

Here's a history of the exercises, along with a brief description of lessons learned.

- 2019-11-08: [US PhD's Awarded](https://github.com/zdelrosario/tidy-exercises/blob/master/2019/2019-02-19-usphds/eda.md)
  + Some disciplines have an *astounding* number of sub-disciplines, especially the Life Sciences.
  + As an engineer, I was very surprised to see that the vast majority of PhD's awarded per-year in the US go to Social and Life scientists, with Engineering, CS, and Math/Stats far fewer in number.
- 2019-11-24: [Dept. of Education Outcomes Data](https://github.com/zdelrosario/tidy-exercises/blob/master/2019/2019-11-22-ed-data/outcomes.md)
  + A large *count* of Title IV funding tends to go to Business Admin majors, but more *dollars* of Title IV funding go (unsurprisingly) to medical professionals.
  + Most engineering degrees seem to have similar earnings; the outliers are Nuclear and Naval degree holders (who earn more), and Environment-related degree holders (who earn less).
  + Computer Technologies/Technician degrees seem to be a racket; these graduates end up with higher debt, but make a bit less than other degree holders.
- 2019-12-03: [Philadelphia Parking Violations](https://github.com/zdelrosario/tidy-exercises/blob/master/2019/2019-12-03-phily-tickets/proc.md)
  + In Philadelpha, incidents of parking violations follow a clear weekly trend, with the greatest violations on Thursdays, and far fewer on the weekends.
  + National holidays lead to far fewer violations as people stay home, but it seems that strong snowstorms have the same effect in this Northeastern city. Having grown up in PA I know what snowstorms are like, but I didn't realize they had a similar effect on traffic violations as national holidays.
